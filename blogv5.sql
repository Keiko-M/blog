To know what groceries you need for your meals, and what snacks are the quickest and tastiest for snack-attacks. Below are 11 hacks and tips that I use to help me make the most nourishing choices, but just use whichever tricks you think would help you the most.', '1. You Eat What You See\r\nIf you want to eat more fruit, keeping them on the counter in clear view might help. Instead of tossing an orange or apple in you bag, take some time to peel or cut it, put it in a container, and leave in on your desk to enjoy when you\'re hungry. Having them ready to go and in plain view also makes it more likely that your partner or children will eat it. Swap out your usual snacks, like chips or crackers, for a more nutrient dense one, like nuts or seeds. \r\n\r\n        It works the other way around too. If you open your pantry, and treats are the first thing you see, you\'re more likely to grab those than to keep hunting for a healthier snack. Move more wholesome choices, like dried fruit or trail mix in front of the more indulgent treats.         \r\n2. Fresher for Longer \r\n        \r\no go with tip #1, we\'re more likely to snack on vegetables, like carrots and celery, if they\'re already chopped up and waiting for us in the fridge. But have you ever noticed that sometimes your prepped veggies lose their crunch, dry up, or develop a slimy film? \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThere is a quick and easy way to avoid that! Just store them in a glass container with water. It helps to keep them crispy and fresh, and they keep for a longer time. Just don\'t forget to change out the water every few days. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nConcerned that pre-cut vegetables might lose some nutrients? There are 3 factors that contribute to nutrient loss: heat, light, and oxygen. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBecause the veggies will be stored in the fridge, the first two points are not a concern. The exposure to oxygen can affect the amount of Vitamin C and sometimes Vitamin E, but what you don\'t lose are all the other incredible nutrients, like B Vitamins, minerals, and fibre. The benefits of eating ready-to-go vegetables, even with less Vitamin C, far outweighs not eating the vegetable at all, or choosing less wholesome convenient food instead.

Those times Polish food was quite spicy and calorific. What’s interesting, polish people were drinking a lot of local beer then (not wine as in most European countries). Flatware was not in use so everyone relished the food only with their hands.\r\n        \r\n        The location of the country and its relations with other states had an impact on the final shape of Polish cuisine. A very strong tradition of hunting was also not without significance. Polish cuisine has a great respect for forest fruits and mushrooms, that is why Polish people are still organizing lovely family trips to the woods in their free time.\r\nMeat, fish, and vegetables were preserved with salt or by the sundrying process. Polesoften used the fermentation and pickling process as well.\r\nDuring the partitions, many accretions of other countries influenced Polish cuisine. Finally, Polish food is the effect of best cooking traditions of neighboring nations (like Czech, German and Austro-Hungarian).', '2018-09-05', NULL, NULL, 104),
(310, 'A Basic Introduction to Vietnamese Food', 'Despite the varied landscape of Vietnam, all of the cuisine contains this brilliant balance of aromatics, heat, sweetness, sourness, and fish-sauciness. As with other Asian cuisines, it\'s all about the yin and yang; the sweet and the salty, the cooling and the warming, the fresh and the fermented.', '\r\nGeography\r\n         To really understand the flavors of Vietnam, it\'s helpful to look at a map first.\r\n\r\nShaped like an elongated S, the skinny country is about the size of Italy, with China to the north, Laos and Cambodia to the west, and the South China Sea to the east. The 3,000-kilometer coastline snakes down, marked by Hanoi in the north, the rugged central highlands, the sprawling Hoi Chi Minh City (aka Saigon) in the south, and the fertile Mekong delta (\"the rice bowl of the country\") at the bottom hook.\r\n\r\nThe food of the north is heavily influenced by China with its stir-fries and noodle-based soups. As you move south, there\'s more flavor-blending with nearby Thailand and Cambodia. The tropical climate down south also sustains more rice paddies, coconut groves, jackfruit trees, and herb gardens. The food in southern Vietnam is typically sweeter: sweeter broths for pho, more palm sugar used in savory dishes, and those popular taffy-like coconut candies made with coconut cream.\r\n\r\nFrench Influence\r\nIt\'s hard to talk about Vietnamese food without mentioning French colonization, which began with missionaries arriving in the 18th century and not ending until 1954. Clearly it had a lasting effect on the country, the people, the architecture, the land, and the flavors. Most obvious might be the banh mi, with its crusty French baguette as the foundation. But the Vietnamese have taken this sandwich and made it entirely their own with grilled pork, fish patties, sardines, cilantro, chili-spiked pickled carrots and other fillings.\r\n\r\nPho (pronounced fuh, like \"fun\" without the \"n\") is another example of French colonialism leaving its mark—the soup is a blend of Vietnamese rice noodles and French-minded meat broths. One theory contends that pho is a phonetic imitation of the French word \"feu\" (fire), as in pot-au-feu. Some say French colonialists slaughtered a bunch of cattle in Vietnam to satisfy their appetite for steak, and the ever-resourceful Vietnamese cooks used the scraps, bones, and any other rejected bits to create pho.\r\n\r\nA quick note on broths: While we\'re talking about pho, our Intrepid Travel guide Hanh (a wonderful guy! hi Hanh!) spent an hour-long car ride from Hoi An to the Denang airport explaining the importance of broth in the act of courtship.\r\n\r\nA mother judges her son\'s significant other on broth-making skills. Lackluster broths could mean no approval from the mother, according to Hanh. He cited some personal examples. A true broth-master knows exactly what stage the broth is in just by sniffing it. This is all to say, the Vietnamese are serious about broth.', '2013-01-24', NULL, NULL, 104),

We had a go at making the prawn and pork Sui Mai dumplings, the beef and ginger dumplings, money bags and also duck spring rolls. I&#39;ll certainly be giving rolling my own spring rolls again. They were surprisingly easy and would make a great dish to serve at a dinner party. Whilst we were waiting for the lunch rush to calm down in the kitchen we were led on a tour of China Town. Making Crispy Duck After our China Town tour, we went to one of the upstairs kitchens that is solely used for making all of the delicious slow cooked belly pork and crispy duck. Here we got to prepare our own crispy duck. Possibly not a stage for the squeamish, and definitely not one for the vegetarians. Don&#39;t worry though we were asked prior to the class if we had any dietary requirements. We were taken through the process of marinating the inside of the duck, sewing it shut, dunking into hot water and glazing it, ready to be dried out and cooked later on. I really enjoyed this part as I&#39;ve never known the processes that go into making a really tasty crispy duck dish. Mastering the Wok I&#39;m sure most people will have used a wok at some point, but by heck the woks we used were like nothing else! Super heavy and able, thanks to the super hot burning stoves, to hold a scalding hot temperature. After a demonstration by the head wok chef, we were each given the chance to cook either beef in black bean sauce (my absolute favourite) or Yeung Chow fried rice. I obviously opted for the beef in black bean sauce, with my friend cooking the friend rice. I&#39;m pleased to say that it wasn&#39;t a disaster. I made a really delicious beef in black bean sauce from scratch in a real life restaurant kitchen. I was completely amazed by how quickly everything is cooked. In total less than 5 minutes for some really delicious food! After we all tried out hand at cooking it was time to sit down and taste the fruits of our labours. Our Feast We sat down at our table and marvelled at the feast in from of us. There were the dishes that we made the beef and black bean sauce and the Yeung chow fried rice. Along with some crispy belly pork, crispy roast duck and sweet and sour chicken. Then came out the lovely Dim Sum, which I&#39;m pretty sure were ones which Harry had made because they looked far too perfect for our efforts!&#60;/p&#62;', '2017-03-01', NULL, NULL, 105),
(312, 'A Post Hike Dinner at The Winking Owl Aviemore ', ' What do you need after a long day on the hill? A hearty pub dinner that&#39;s what! When we stayed in Aviemore our prayers and pangs of hunger were answered by The Winking Owl. It was a fantastic local brewery.', '&#60;p&#62;Owned by the Cairngorm Brewery, The Winking Owl is a lovely pub with a wonderful homely feeling and epic menu. We&#39;d just done a tough walk, so we needed to refuel and the menu was perfect for this. As they are owned by the brewery the beer selection is good, but the gin lover in me also loved their gin selection. I mainly stuck to Kinrara Gin, which is made just outside of Aviemore. So we kept our drinks local all night! It was so much fun. Starters To start I went with the Haggis Pakora with Chilli Jam. Now, spoiler alert, I&#39;ve eaten here before and had this dish before. But it was back in 2014 and I couldn&#39;t resist ordering again as it is just so good. Earthy haggis, with sweet and spicy chilli jam, the perfect pairing. I really recommend. Dr W picked the Cullen Skink with Smoked Haddock and a Scotch Egg! Yes you heard right, a scotch egg in the soup. Trust me, it was awesome. Dr W was a happy happy man. Mains For our mains we both picked the Venison Haunch Steak, with Black Pepper Potato Press, Red Cabbage and Shallot. Wow, this was rich and decadent! I really could&#39;ve done with some green beans on the side (wasn&#39;t an option) but I enjoyed it all the same. The black pudding and potato was a new one on me, but one I am happy to embrace! It was a delicious dish and the steak was perfectly cooked for me (on the rare side). Now, as we both picked the same I thought I&#39;d share what one of our friends picked, the Beef with Cairngorm Black Gold Beer and Mushroom Pie with Chips and Roast Veg. Just wow! What a portion! The perfect recovery after a long day. I was lucky to try some and that beef was proper melt in the mouth, the same goes for the pastry. It really was an epic dish. Overall We had a lovely meal at The Winking Owl. The service was fantastic and the server was knowledgeable about the menu - super helpful for the indecisive ones. I know we ordered meat heavy but veggies you are catered for and vegans just ask. It&#39;s all cooked fresh and produce is as local as possible. It really is worth a visit and we will be back next time we&#39;re in Aviemore - mainly because we couldn&#39;t get enough of the Bothy Bar downstairs! Would you take a trip to The Winking Owl? What would you order? Let me know in the comments&#60;/p&#62;', '2019-03-21', NULL, NULL, 105),
(313, '15 food trends for 2019', '  From surging health trends to hidden veg and Burmese cuisine, this is going to be another rollercoaster year in how we cook, shop, drink and eat at home and in restaurants.', '&#60;p&#62;1. Sri Lankan cuisine Restaurants such as London&#39;s Hoppers, mini chain The Coconut Tree and the success of the M&#38;amp;S Taste Asia range have put Sri Lankan food on the brink of a breakthrough. Think hoppers (bowl-shaped rice flour pancakes), kottu roti (fried veg, eggs, shredded roti and curry, as sold by street stall Kottu Lanka) and pol sambol coconut relish. Before, Sri Lankan was lumped in with Indian cuisine but now, we&#39;re not having an Indian anymore. It&#39;s recognised in its own right, says Emma Weinbren, food trends editor at retail magazine The Grocer. 2. Burmese cuisine Restaurant analysts are tipping Burmese food &#38;nbsp;check out London&#39;s Lahpet and the @RangoonSisters supper club or try our recipe for tohu jaw, Burmese fritters. Coming this year from the same author, MiMi Aye, Mandalay, a Burmese recipe book. 3. Meat-free Britain&#39;s attitude to meat is changing dramatically. When Marston&#39;s pubs are serving a bleeding burger, and restaurants as varied as Gauthier Soho and the Hackney chippy Sutton &#38;amp; Sons are in various stages of turning vegan, clearly something seismic is happening. According to data seen by M&#38;amp;S (poised to launch a new range of vegan ready meals and on-the-go options), 3.5 million people now identify as vegan, 20% of under-35s have tried veganism, and 25% of our evening meals are now meat-free. It&#39;s no longer niche, agrees Weinbren. And this isn&#39;t just committed vegans but people saying, I want to cut down my meat intake. This growth in plant-based eating, says Good Food wine guru, Victoria Moore, is also causing major retailers to increase the number of vegan wines they stock. It&#39;s all down to the fining agent, explains Moore. Some are derived from fish or dairy products.&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;4. Kefir Sales of Lakeland&#39;s kefir kit are flying along with M&#38;amp;S&#39;s kombucha. As customers come to understand the positive in influence of bacteria on gut health, the global fermented drinks market is in huge growth, reports M&#38;amp;S food trends insight manager Helen Arpino. Want to get next-level? Try the coffee bean kombucha at London&#39;s Little Duck Picklery.&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;5. Ugly fruit &#38;amp; veg Ocado buyer India Moore says, We&#39;re seeing exciting products made using misshapen fruit and veg that would otherwise go to waste, such as crisps and hummus. Eco-friendly searches on ocado.com leapt 93% last year, and we can see this rescued food trend gaining momentum in 2019. Get inspired with our ideas for homemade vegetable crisps. Good Food also loves the bars pushing green drinks, including cocktail expert Ryan Chetiyawardana&#39;s explorations in sustainability at London&#39;s Cub and Dandelyan and barman Jack Wakelin&#39;s use of tasty garbage at Sheffield&#39;s Public &#38;nbsp;for instance, cordials made from used citrus.&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;6. Hidden vegetables Gato &#38;amp; Co puddings (that use vegetables to reduce refined sugar content) and Dr Oetker&#39;s new Yes, It&#39;s Pizza vegetable-dough bases are indicative of how many people are keen to cut down on carbs and increase their intake of vegetables &#38;nbsp;but without forgoing lifes indulgences. You can expect to see more hidden vegetable products in 2019. If you&#39;re looking to sneak more vegetables into your child&#39;s diet, see our best hidden veg recipes for kids.&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;7. Rum Rum is coming up fast. Millenials are particularly partial to barrel-aged, small-batch craft rums, fine rums from traditional Caribbean makers and now, British rums from, for instance, Essex&#39;s English Spirit. Whether you like it strong or sweet, prefer the harshness of white spirit, or dark rum sipped neat with ice, or a golden rum and coke, it&#39;s one of the most accessible spirits, says Nicholas Robinson, food and drink editor at bar magazine, Morning Advertiser.&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;8. Food halls Fittingly, given that it kick-started the craze for communal dining halls serviced by multiple kitchens, Altrincham Market House (@MarketHouseAlty), which also runs the Mackie Mayor in Manchester will open a third food hall in Macclesfield this year. In London, Market Halls are set to open Britain&#39;s biggest on Oxford Street, in the former BHS building, while others are being developed in Stockport, Sheffield, on the Wirral and beyond.&#60;/p&#62;', '2019-01-01', NULL, NULL, 105),

(315, 'Barrafina', ' ', '&#60;p&#62;Barrafina | Soho, Covent Garden &#38;amp; King&#39;s Cross Restaurants Let us, for a brief moment, give thanks to Spain, who have gifted the world Pablo Picasso, Don Quixote, The Alliance of Civilisations and, probably most importantly, Barrafina. At least, in a roundabout way, that is. See, Barrafina, London&#39;s best Spanish restaurant, actually comes from two English brothers, Sam and Eddie Hart, inspired by the famous Cal Pep tapas restaurant in Barcelona.&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Considering Barrafina&#39;s significance in the London restaurant scene, it seems possible that someone, one day, many years from now, may ask you what it was like to dine there. And so we&#39;ve prepared a sample response for you: Imagine walking into a scleral-white, cosy eatery packed with stainless steel, marble and mirrors, and sitting down at an open kitchen bar where arguably London&#39;s most prestigious Spanish tapas chefs are plating up a colourful mixture of both contemporary and traditional Mallorcan and Catalan tapas dishes. Then, imagine leisurely perusing the menu, while watching those chefs gracefully slice wafer-thin, rose-pink cured meats from whole legs hanging on proud display above the bed of iced, fresh seafood behind the bar. And finally, imagine being able to talk to the chefs while they recommend the perfect red and white wine and sherry pairings for the (Michelin-starred) dishes they&#39;re plating you up, while the rest of the bar gaggle and bop their way through the thick atmosphere, to the music of modern Spain.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Or, alternatively, you could go and see for yourself. Either way. There are now four branches of Barrafina in London, each of which serve that stupendous tapas menu bolstered by a few characteristic specials.&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Here&#39;s what you can expect in each one:&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;BARRAFINA DEAN STREET | Soho When the landlords of the original Barrafina on Frith Street decided to redevelop the building instead of continuing to host, you know, the most popular restaurant in London, the flagship set sail for Dean Street instead, where it&#39;s made a new home in the ground floor of Quo Vadis (also run by the Harts). Sporting the characteristic marble dining counter, bustling open kitchen and somewhat Bavarian-looking beer pumps, it&#39;s settled in nicely. Leave room for the Santiago tart; a traditional Galician almond cake.&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Details: 26-27 Dean Street, W1D 3LL | Open M-S 12-3pm and 5-11pm, Sun 1-3.30pm, 5.30-10pm&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;BARRAFINA ADELAIDE STREET | Covent Garden Happily a little more spacious than its sibling, Barrafina Adelaide Street is flooded with light, and has a dedicated space for drinks while you&#39;re waiting for your spot at the counter. There are subtle differences in the menu between each branch, so head here for a wider selection of seafood, or if you have a particular penchant for cuttlefish croquetas; crispy pig&#39;s ears; and milk-fed lamb&#39;s brain.&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Details: 10 Adelaide Street, WC2N 4HZ | Open M-S 12-3pm and 5-11pm, Sun 1-3.30pm, 5.30-10pm&#60;/p&#62;', '2019-04-12', NULL, NULL, 106),

But luckily, this handmade pasta spot is actually very affordable.

It’s unlikely to be the best version of each you’ll ever try, but it’s the best in the area if you’re looking for a low price.

The good guys are those who, as the name suggests, just love the industry with a not-to-be-denied passion and, despite not being pros, can’t imagine doing anything else.\r\n\r\nIt’s into this latter category that I’d put the people behind Pidgin: James Ramsden and Sam Herlihy (neither trained in the restaurant business, but with a successful supperclub under their belts), alongside Elizabeth Allen in the kitchen. Allen’s most recent gig was at Neil Rankin’s ballsy Smokehouse in Islington; she’s staged at L’Enclume and has a love for Asian flavours – miso, sake lees, shiso, dashi.

Inevitably with a set, no-choice menu, there’s one dish that makes me think “nope”, but the squash spaghetti turns out to be our dinner’s dazzling turn. It’s not, as I’d imagined, spaghetti squash, but the less squelchy butternut, spiralised and dressed with brown butter and a nut-laced dukkah spice mix. At a time when many chefs think they need to dial flavours up to 11, the subtlety here is sexy: seductive interplay between textures, various degrees of nuttiness, including what looks alarmingly maggoty but turns out to be clever – puffed wild rice.
